    /*
        Just in case you're wondering where this simple formula comes from:
        We're trying to compute the amount of each token we'd need to buy to cover the budget,
        while keeping total token ratios constant.

           Below:
             - values with capital letters are vectors, lowercase are scalars.
             - "." is the scalar product.
             - "*" & "/" on two vectors in term-by-term multiplication/division
             - Before is the current holdings (before deposit)
             - After is the holdings, after deposit
             - Prices are token prices in budget units
                    (ex: if we have a budget of 1$, and we want to buy 1 sushi, then a price would be quoted in $/sushi)

        1) We know how our total budget ðŸ‘‰ budget = sum(Budgets)
        2) We're looking for ðŸ‘‰ ToBuy = After - Before
        3) Budgets can be expressed from qties to buy ðŸ‘‰ ToBuy * Prices = Budgets
        4) Or, as a scalar prodct, input budget is ðŸ‘‰ (After - Before) . Prices = budget
        5) We want constant ratios  ðŸ‘‰ (1/ (After . Prices)) * After  = (1/(Before . Prices)) * Before
        6) Prices are computed from a preliminary 0x pricing run ðŸ‘‰ Prices = PricingBudget / PricingTokens

        Thus:
            Lets name "curValue = Before . Prices"
            (4)         => After . Prices = budget + curValue
            (5)         => After  = ((After . Prices) / curValue) * Before
                        => After = ((budget + curValue) / curValue) * Before
            (with 2)    => ToBuy =  ((budget + curValue) / curValue - 1) * Before
                        => ToBuy =  (budget / curValue) * Before
            (with 3)    => Budgets = (budget / curValue) * Before * Prices

            ... which is the formula we're using below, taking care to perform
             divisions as late as possible to avoid rounding errors,
             given that we're using bignumbers
             (which are integers)
             Meaning:

            (with 6)    => Budgets = budget * Before * PricingBudget / (curValue * PricingTokens)
    */

    const before = currentHoldings.map(h => h.amount);
    const curValue = toBudgetDotProduct(before, prices); // value, in budget units, of current holdings
    const budgets = before.map((b, i) => addBudget.mul(b).mul(prices[i].pBudget).div(prices[i].pToken.mul(curValue)));
    return budgets;
}

/** Dot product of a bignumber vector & a price vectors */
function toBudgetDotProduct(a: BigNumber[], b: Price[]): BigNumber {
    return a.reduce((acc, v, i) => acc.add(v.mul(b[i].pBudget).div(b[i].pToken)), BigNumber.from(0));
}

function negate(value: BigNumber): BigNumber {
    return BigNumber.from(0).sub(value);
}
